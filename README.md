# 📊 EcoTrade Customer Segmentation Using R

This project uses **R and tidyverse** to analyze EcoTrade’s customer demographics and generate actionable insights to support data-driven decisions around **marketing**, **sales**, and **sustainability goals**.

It complements the [Power BI Dashboard version](https://github.com/Ashley-sdev/EcoTrade-CustomerInsights-PowerBI), forming part of a broader business intelligence solution.


## 🧠 Project Objective

To segment EcoTrade customers based on **income**, **age**, and **region**, and visualize:
- Which customer age groups are the most profitable
- Where most customers are located
- Preferences for **certified vs. non-certified** products

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- 💻 **R** (Data analysis, cleaning, and visualization)
- 📦 **tidyverse** (dplyr, ggplot2, readr, etc.)
- 📈 **ggplot2** for charts
- 🧼 CSV data: `Customer_Demographics.csv`

## 🔍 Summary of Key Insights

- Customers aged **65+** have the **highest average income**
- Most customers come from **Europe**, followed by **Asia** and **North America**
- Simulated preference analysis shows a stronger leaning toward **certified products**
- Younger segments may benefit from **budget-focused eco-friendly offers**

## 🧼 Data Cleaning & Transformation

- Removed records with missing `Age` or `Income`
- Created an `AgeGroup` column with the following buckets:
  - 18–24, 25–34, 35–49, 50–64, 65+
- Added a **simulated column** `CertPreference` using random sampling (70% Certified)
